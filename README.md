Java program to count number of code lines in your workspace, organize it into Projects and keep history of line number in each of them. After that it will generate a HTML page with charts (using Highcharts) so you can easily see which project stucked and which is skyrocketing, after all you can share it (or via web page or by picture and so on).

Comming soon!
